# GO-with-design-patterns

Go(lang) of late has been gaining quite some momentum for building highly scalable, concurrent and cloud native Web Services.

Personally, GO seems to be like a mixture of functional and object oriented languages. Specifically the idea of Closures and currying from JS (functional), interfaces and struct from C# and others (OOP) and syntaxes and pointers closely resembling C.
It seems to have a very small feature set but two ideas which is definitely worth taking.

+ CSP model which allows for high concurrency
+ No support for inheritance altogether. This avoids inheritance misuse found in almost all applications.

This is an attempt to implement my existing understanding of Design Patterns in C# and port it into the constructs of GO.
